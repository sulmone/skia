/** @file
    This file contains specializations for OpenGL of the shader stages declared in
    include/gpu/GrEffect.h. Objects of type GrGLEffect are responsible for emitting the
    GLSL code that implements a GrEffect and for uploading uniforms at draw time. They also
    must have a function:
        static inline StageKey GenKey(const GrEffect&, const GrGLCaps&)
    that is used to implement a program cache. When two GrEffects produce the same key this means
    that their GrGLProgramStages would emit the same GLSL code.

    These objects are created by the factory object returned by the GrEffect::getFactory().

        @param effect       The effect that generated this program stage.
        @param key          The key that was computed by StageKey() from the generating GrEffect.

                            be removed soon and stages will be responsible for computing their own
                            coords.
        @param outputColor  A predefined vec4 in the FS in which the stage should place its output
                            color (or coverage).
        @param inputColor   A vec4 that holds the input color to the stage in the FS. This may be
                            NULL in which case the implied input is solid white (all ones).

                            color is solid white, trans black, known to be opaque, etc.) that allows
                            the effect to communicate back similar known info about its output.

                            GrGLEffect. These can be passed to the builder to emit texture
                            reads in the generated code.
